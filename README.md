### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to visualize population and migration trends using data from the United Nations. The dashboard allows users to interact with the data, choose specific years, regions, and variables, and analyze migration and population flows in an intuitive and informative way.

### Datasets:
#### Demographic Indicators:
- Contains global population data and key demographic indicators such as birth rates, mortality rates, and life expectancy.
- Link to data source
#### International Migration Stock (IMS):
- Provides data on the number of migrants, categorized by destination, sex, and area of origin.
- Link to data source

### Key Features
- Choropleth Maps: Interactive maps to visualize population and migration patterns geographically. You can zoom in and pan around different regions of the world.
- Stacked Bar Charts: Compare population and migration trends across different regions, years, and genders.
- Scatter Line Graphs: Visualize trends over time for specific demographic and migration data points.
- Interactive Elements:
- Customizable Views: Users can choose different years, countries, and demographic variables from dropdown menus to personalize their analysis.
- Tooltips: Hovering over data points reveals detailed information, improving the user experience and providing deeper insights.
- Download Feature: Each visual element can be saved as an image for future reference.

### Project Setup
Prerequisites:
Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
plotly
dash
numpy

### Data Preprocessing
- The data required some preprocessing to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- IMS Data: Columns were renamed for clarity, and missing values were handled by imputing or removing records as necessary.
- Demographics Data: The population data was filtered to focus on years relevant to migration trends.

### Visualizations
- Choropleth Map: Visualizes the global migration stock by destination, with different color intensities representing the number of migrants.
- Stacked Bar Chart: Displays the population of various regions over time, comparing male and female populations.
- Scatter Line Graph: Tracks the progression of migration stock from different income-level countries (low, middle, high) over the years.

### Key Insights
- Population Growth: The world population has been increasing consistently, with India and China being the most populous countries.
- Migration Trends: High-income countries saw a substantial rise in migration stock from 1990 to 2020, while middle and low-income countries showed moderate increases.
- Gender Disparity: There are slight differences in male and female migration patterns, with male migrants being more prevalent in certain regions like Europe and Oceania.
